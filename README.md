"Who-Does-That" is a name for a start-up application. This app connects people who are looking for a business for varieties of services 
with related businesses.

-We designed ER diagram and Relational Database based on the requirements. We communicate with client by in-person meetings or via email to have a better understanding of their requirements.
-Implemented the tables by considering all restrictions
- Wrote some queries with MySQL to retrieve/update data for designed questions by the client

By this project, I get the real business world experience of communicating and deliver a project for a company.
